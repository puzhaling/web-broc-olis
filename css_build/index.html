          <p class="article-body">
            C++ (pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a
            high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish
            computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an
            extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded
            significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented,
            generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for
            low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to
            make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is usually
            implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
            compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft,
            Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM. C++ was designed with systems
            programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large
            systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of
            use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many
            other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
            resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications,
            video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases),
            and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or
            space probes).

          <p class="article-body">
            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its
            design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
            significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and
            garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
            including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
            functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
            included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. Guido
            van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor
            to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as
            Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released
            in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible
            with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last
            release of Python 2. Python was invented in the late 1980s by
            Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica (CWI) in the
            Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which
            was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and
            interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation
            began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole
            responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July
            2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his
            responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL),
            a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his
            long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker  (he
            has since come out of retirement and is self-titled
            "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers
            elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.
